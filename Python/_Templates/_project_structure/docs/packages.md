# template_package 
 - This is a template package for rapid prototyping and development. It provides a basic structure for creating Python packages with ease, including support for versioning, documentation, and testing.

## my_module.py

- This module defines a class `MyModule` with methods to retrieve version information and represent the object as a string. 
- The `get_version_info()` method returns a formatted string containing the class name, package name, author's name, and version number. 
- Finally, the `main()` function prints the version information and an example of how to initialize the `MyModule` class using the `repr()` function.
